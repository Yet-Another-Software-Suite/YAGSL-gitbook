# JSON Configuration Schema

YAGSL builds a YAMS `SwerveDrive` from a directory of JSON files. `SwerveParser`
(`swervelib.commands2.SwerveParser` or `swervelib.commands3.SwerveParser`, both built on
`swervelib.core.parser.SwerveParser`) reads this directory and constructs the equivalent YAMS
`SwerveDriveConfig` / `SwerveModuleConfig` / `SmartMotorControllerConfig` objects for you. You
rarely need to hand-edit these files, since [config.yagsl.com](https://config.yagsl.com) generates
them for you, but knowing the schema is useful for debugging, scripting, or hand-tweaking a single
value.

## Directory layout

```
src/main/deploy
└── swerve
    └── base                       <- name is arbitrary, passed to `SwerveParser.parse(...)`
        ├── swervedrive.json
        └── modules
            ├── frontleft.json
            ├── frontright.json
            ├── backleft.json
            ├── backright.json     <- module filenames are arbitrary, referenced by swervedrive.json
            ├── physicalproperties.json
            ├── pidfproperties.json
            └── pidfproperties_sim.json   (optional)
```

`SwerveParser.parse(directory)` reads, in order:

1. `swervedrive.json`: top-level drive config, the gyro plus the list of module files.
2. `modules/pidfproperties.json`: default PID + feedforward gains shared by every module. If
   `modules/pidfproperties_sim.json` also exists, it's used instead whenever
   `RobotBase.isSimulation()` is `true`, so you can tune sim and real gains independently.
3. `modules/physicalproperties.json`: default gearing and current limits shared by every module.
4. Each file listed in `swervedrive.json`'s `modules` array: one per swerve module, describing that
   module's hardware, wiring, and location. A module file may override the gearing from
   `physicalproperties.json` with its own `gearing` object.

The JSON is read with WPILib's JSON library (avaje-jsonb), using adapters generated at compile time
for the classes in `swervelib.core.parser.json`. Fields a class doesn't have (for example a
`$schema` key, or a field left over from an older config) are ignored rather than rejected, and
fields missing from a file keep the default listed on each page.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Device `type` strings are **not** checked while the files are read. An invalid or unsupported
`type` only fails later, when `SwerveParser.createSwerveDrive(...)` builds that device.

## Control system and CAN buses

YAGSL 2027 runs on the SystemCore, which has several CAN buses of its own (`can_s0` to `can_s4`)
and more on an attached Motioncore (`can_d0` to `can_d19`). Every device's `canbus` field is read
the same way for every vendor, by `swervelib.core.parser.CANBuses`:

| `canbus` value          | CAN bus                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `""` (empty or missing) | SystemCore `can_s0`                                                  |
| `"0"` to `"4"`          | SystemCore `can_s0` to `can_s4`, so `"1"` is `can_s1`                |
| `"5"` to `"24"`         | Motioncore `can_d0` to `can_d19`, so `"5"` is `can_d0`               |
| any other number        | Rejected with `CAN bus <n> does not exist`                           |
| anything else           | Passed to the vendor as is, such as a CANivore's name for CTRE devices |

The bus numbers follow WPILib's `CANPort` enum. Whitespace around the value is trimmed, and
`canbus` is always a JSON **string** (`"1"`, not `1`). For a step by step guide, see
[Put devices on a different CAN bus](../../how-to/choose-a-can-bus.md).

What each vendor does with a value that is not a bus number:

| Vendor                                              | Non-numeric `canbus`                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CTRE (`talonfx_*`, `talonfxs_*`, `pigeon2_can`, `cancoder_can`) | Used as the Phoenix 6 `CANBus` name, such as a CANivore's name or serial number. |
| Redux (`canandgyro_can`, `canandmag_can`)           | Used as a ReduxLib bus string, such as `"socketcan:can_s1"`.            |
| REV (`sparkmax_*`, `sparkflex_*`, `splineencoder_can`) | Rejected. REV devices only accept `""` or a bus number.               |
| ThriftyBot (`nova_*`)                               | Rejected. Thrifty devices only accept `""` or a bus number.             |

`canbus` is ignored for devices that aren't on CAN (`systemcore_internal`, `custom`, and `_dio`,
`_analog`, and `_attached` absolute encoders). It is currently also ignored by `navx3_can` and
`andymarkhexbore_can`, which are always created on their vendor library's default bus.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Changed in 2027:** a CTRE device with an empty `canbus` is now on `can_s0`, like every other
vendor. Before the `canbus` values were unified in `2026.10.09` it ended up on `can_s2`, so a CTRE
device wired to `can_s2` now needs `"canbus": "2"`. REV devices no longer accept a port name such as
`"can_s1"`; use the bus number `"1"`.
