# Gyroscopes

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Hardware support narrowed in the 2026.8.05 rewrite.** YAGSL only builds CAN gyros and, since
2027, the IMU inside the SystemCore. The SPI/I2C/USB-serial NavX (original NavX2 `navx`/`navx_spi`/
`navx_i2c`/`navx_mxp_serial`/`navx_usb`), the original CTRE **Pigeon** (gen 1), and the SPI gyros
(**ADXRS450**, **ADIS16448**, **ADIS16470**) are **not supported** by the parser. If your robot
uses a gyro that isn't in the table below, see [Schema Changes](../schema-changes.md) and use the
[`custom` gyro type](#custom-gyro) to wire it up yourself.
{% endhint %}

## Gyroscope Checklist

* [ ] Gyroscope readings increase when rotated counter-clockwise (CCW+).
* [ ] Yaw reading is the robot heading.
* [ ] Gyroscope `0°` is the desired robot "front".

## Configuring the gyro

In `swervedrive.json` the gyro is one object plus two drive-wide settings:

```json
{
  "gyro": {
    "type": "pigeon2_can",
    "id": 13,
    "canbus": "canivore"
  },
  "gyroAxis": "yaw",
  "gyroInvert": true,
  "modules": ["frontleft.json", "frontright.json", "backleft.json", "backright.json"]
}
```

- `gyro.type`: one of the supported types below, formatted `vendor_connection`, or `custom` to
  configure the gyro yourself (see [Custom Gyro](#custom-gyro)).
- `gyro.id`: CAN ID of the device (ignored where not applicable).
- `gyro.canbus`: the CAN bus the device is on. Use `""` for the SystemCore bus `can_s0`, or the bus
  number, such as `"1"` for `can_s1`. A Pigeon 2 also takes a CANivore's name. See
  [Control system and CAN buses](../json-schema/README.md#control-system-and-can-buses).
- `gyroAxis`: which axis of the sensor points up through the robot and is read as the heading:
  `yaw` (default), `pitch`, or `roll`. Only change this if the sensor is mounted on an edge or
  angle.
- `gyroInvert`: invert the heading reading. If your robot spins out of control with no controller
  input, invert this.

The parser hands YAMS the gyro's full 3D attitude (a `Supplier<Rotation3d>`) untouched. YAMS then
applies `gyroAxis` (`SwerveDriveConfig.withGyroHeadingAxis`) and `gyroInvert`
(`SwerveDriveConfig.withGyroInverted`) in one place, so no gyro is inverted twice. Read the result
in robot code with `SwerveDrive.getGyroRotation3d()`; the old `getGyroAngle()` is gone.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**CTRE default bus changed in 2027.** A Pigeon 2 with `"canbus": ""` is now on `can_s0`, like every
other vendor's devices. It used to end up on `can_s2`; if yours is wired to `can_s2`, set
`"canbus": "2"`.
{% endhint %}

## Supported gyroscope types

| Device | `type` | Communication | Vendor library |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Pigeon 2](#pigeon-2) | `pigeon2_can` | CAN; bus number or CANivore name | Phoenix 6 |
| [Canandgyro](#canandgyro) | `canandgyro_can` | CAN; bus number or ReduxLib bus string | ReduxLib |
| [SystemCore IMU](#systemcore-imu) | `systemcore_internal` | Built into the SystemCore; `id` and `canbus` are ignored | none (part of WPILib) |
| [NavX3-CAN](#navx3-can) | `navx3_can` | CAN. *Not available in the 2027 builds yet, see [below](#navx3-can).* | StudicaLib |
| [Custom](#custom-gyro) | `custom` | *any*: you construct and supply the gyro yourself | whatever your gyro needs |

The vendor library is loaded by reflection only when your config uses that gyro, so install the one
for the gyro you have. See [Vendordep Installation](../vendordep-installation.md).

If you need a gyro not on this list, use the `custom` type below.

## Custom Gyro

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the reference summary. For a full walkthrough see
[How to use a custom gyro](../../how-to/use-a-custom-gyro.md).
{% endhint %}

Set `gyro.type` to `custom` and YAGSL's parser skips gyro configuration entirely: it never calls
`SwerveDriveConfig.withGyro()`/`withGyroHeadingAxis()`/`withGyroInverted()`, and
`gyroAxis`/`gyroInvert` in `swervedrive.json` are ignored. You're expected to call them yourself on
the `SwerveDriveConfig` you pass into `SwerveParser.createSwerveDrive(...)`. Everything else in the
config (modules, motor controllers, encoders) is still built normally from the JSON.

`withGyro()` takes a `Supplier<Rotation3d>`: the gyro's full attitude, not just a heading angle.
Most vendor gyros and WPILib's `OnboardIMU` have a `getRotation3d()` you can pass directly.

This is the escape hatch for any gyro the parser doesn't build for you. The example below uses it
for a SystemCore that is mounted vertically, since `systemcore_internal` always assumes a
SystemCore mounted flat.

```json title="swervedrive.json"
{
  "gyro": { "type": "custom", "id": 0, "canbus": "" },
  "gyroAxis": "yaw",
  "gyroInvert": false,
  "modules": ["frontleft.json", "frontright.json", "backleft.json", "backright.json"]
}
```

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Commands v2" %}
```java title="SwerveDriveSubsystem.java"
import org.wpilib.hardware.imu.OnboardIMU;
import org.wpilib.hardware.imu.OnboardIMU.MountOrientation;
import swervelib.commands2.SwerveParser;
import yams.commands2.config.SwerveDriveConfig;
import yams.core.mechanisms.config.enums.GyroAxis;
import yams.core.telemetry.enums.TelemetryVerbosity;

// SystemCore mounted vertically, with its long edge parallel to the ground.
private final OnboardIMU gyro = new OnboardIMU(MountOrientation.LANDSCAPE);

public SwerveDriveSubsystem() {
  var cfg = new SwerveDriveConfig()
      .withSubsystem(this)
      .withTelemetry("swerve", TelemetryVerbosity.HIGH)
      .withGyro(gyro::getRotation3d)
      // gyroAxis and gyroInvert are ignored for a "custom" gyro, so set them here.
      .withGyroHeadingAxis(GyroAxis.YAW)
      .withGyroInverted(false);

  SwerveParser.parse(new File(Filesystem.getDeployDirectory(), "swerve/base"));
  drive = SwerveParser.createSwerveDrive(cfg);
}
```

import yams.core.mechanisms.config.enums.GyroAxis;
import yams.core.telemetry.enums.TelemetryVerbosity;

// SystemCore mounted vertically, with its long edge parallel to the ground.
private final OnboardIMU gyro = new OnboardIMU(MountOrientation.LANDSCAPE);

public SwerveDriveMechanism() {
  var cfg = new SwerveDriveConfig()
      .withMechanism(this)
      .withTelemetry("swerve", TelemetryVerbosity.HIGH)
      .withGyro(gyro::getRotation3d)
      // gyroAxis and gyroInvert are ignored for a "custom" gyro, so set them here.
      .withGyroHeadingAxis(GyroAxis.YAW)
      .withGyroInverted(false);

  SwerveParser.parse(new File(Filesystem.getDeployDirectory(), "swerve/base"));
  drive = SwerveParser.createSwerveDrive(cfg);
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Because the parser never calls `withGyroInverted()` for a `custom` gyro, a gyro that reads
clockwise positive needs `.withGyroInverted(true)` on your own config. Don't also negate the
attitude inside the supplier, or the heading is inverted twice.
{% endhint %}

## SystemCore IMU

`systemcore_internal` uses the IMU built into the SystemCore through WPILib's
`org.wpilib.hardware.imu.OnboardIMU`. It needs no vendor library and no wiring, and `id` and
`canbus` are ignored.

```json
"gyro": { "type": "systemcore_internal", "id": 0, "canbus": "" }
```

**Checklist**

* [ ] SystemCore is mounted **flat** (parallel to the ground). The parser always creates the IMU
  with `MountOrientation.FLAT`.
* [ ] SystemCore is mounted rigidly and as close to the robot's center as practical.

If your SystemCore is mounted vertically (`MountOrientation.LANDSCAPE` or `PORTRAIT`), create the
`OnboardIMU` yourself with a [custom gyro](#custom-gyro), as shown above.

## NavX3-CAN

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Not available in the 2027 builds yet.** StudicaLib has no `2027_alpha7` release, so the YAGSL
2027 artifacts are built without the NavX3 device class. `navx3_can` is still accepted by the
schema, but creating the drive with it fails. Until StudicaLib is released for 2027, use another
gyro or supply the NavX yourself through a [custom gyro](#custom-gyro).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
NavX3-CAN supports CAN 2.0 and has CAN-FD capability. See Studica's notes for CAN-FD
requirements.
{% endhint %}

- [Studica product page](https://www.studica.co/navx3-can-imu)
- [Studica NavX releases, firmware tools, and vendordeps](https://github.com/Studica-Robotics/NavX)

**Checklist**

* [ ] Install the **StudicaLib** vendordep (do not install both `Studica` and `StudicaLib`).
* [ ] Update NavX3-CAN firmware to **5.0.4+** using Studica Hardware Manager.
* [ ] Use Studica Hardware Manager to find the CAN ID (often ships as `0`) and enter it in your
  config.

The parser creates the NavX3 from its CAN ID only; `canbus` is ignored for this device.

NavX3-CAN ships factory-calibrated. For higher accuracy, re-calibrate with Studica Hardware
Manager, which auto-detects sensor orientation during calibration. Connect CAN-H/CAN-L to the
robot bus and make sure the bus is properly terminated.

## Pigeon 2

- [Product page](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/pigeon-2/)
- [Hardware reference](https://pro.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/latest/docs/hardware-reference/pigeon2/index.html)
- Upgradeable via [Tuner X](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/latest/docs/tuner/index.html).
  Pay attention to the LED status code when debugging.

**Checklist**

* [ ] Yaw increments counter-clockwise positive.
* [ ] Pigeon 2 is mounted as close to the robot's center as possible.
* [ ] Updated to the latest firmware, on a unique CAN ID.
* [ ] Calibrated once installed on the robot.
* [ ] **Phoenix 6** vendordep installed.

Communicates over CAN. Set `canbus` to `""` for `can_s0` or to the bus number of another SystemCore
bus. It can also be paired with a [CANivore](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/canivore/):
[set a CANivore name](https://pro.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/latest/docs/canivore/canivore-setup.html)
and use it as `canbus`.

## Canandgyro

- [Getting started](https://docs.reduxrobotics.com/canandgyro/getting-started)
- CAN only; does not support CANivore.
- Requires the **ReduxLib** vendordep.
- `canbus` is `""` for `can_s0` or a bus number. Any other value is handed to ReduxLib as a bus
  string, such as `"socketcan:can_s1"`.
- If you are coming from an older YAGSL version where you had to flip `gyroInvert` to work around
  the Canandgyro being inverted twice, re-check it: the inversion is now only applied once, by
  YAMS.

---

### General gyro tips (still apply regardless of device)

- Mount the gyro as close to the robot's center of rotation as practical. Off-center mounting
  couples translational vibration into the heading reading.
- Always keep the robot still for a few seconds after power-on if your device does an on-the-fly
  calibration; moving during that window produces a bad heading for the rest of the match.
- If the robot's heading drifts over a match, see [Swerve Drive Drift Causes](../swerve-drift-causes.md).
