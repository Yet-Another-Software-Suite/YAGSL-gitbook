# Motor Controllers

{% hint style="danger" %}
**TalonSRX and brushed SparkMAX are no longer supported.** The pre-2026.8.05 `talonsrx` and
`sparkmax_brushed` types have been removed. YAGSL now only drives brushless motors through
YAMS's `SmartMotorController` abstraction. See [Schema Changes](../schema-changes.md).
{% endhint %}

## Motor Checklist

* [ ] All motors spin counterclockwise positive (CCW+); document any inversions required to
  achieve that.
* [ ] Motor is updated to the latest firmware.
* [ ] Motor has a unique CAN ID that matches its module JSON.
* [ ] Wheels are aligned forwards with all bevels facing the same way before first enable.
* [ ] PID is tuned. See [Tune PIDF Gains](../../how-to/tune-pidf-gains.md).

## Configuring a motor

Each module JSON (`frontleft.json`, etc.) has a `drive` and an `angle` motor, both `DeviceJson`
objects of the form `"<controller>_<motor>"`:

```json
{
  "drive": { "type": "sparkflex_vortex", "id": 5, "canbus": "" },
  "angle":  { "type": "sparkmax_neo550", "id": 6, "canbus": "" }
}
```

The `<motor>` suffix tells YAGSL which `DCMotor` model to use for feedforward and simulation
characterization (free speed, stall torque, etc.). It must match the physical motor attached to
that controller.

`canbus` is the CAN bus the controller is on: `""` for the SystemCore bus `can_s0`, or the bus
number, such as `"1"` for `can_s1`. See
[Control system and CAN buses](../json-schema/README.md#control-system-and-can-buses).

## Supported controller × motor combinations

| Controller | `type` values |
|---|---|
| [TalonFX](#talonfx-kraken-x60-kraken-x44) | `talonfx_krakenx44`, `talonfx_krakenx60`, `talonfx_falcon`, `talonfx_falcon500` |
| [TalonFXS](#talonfxs) | `talonfxs_neo`, `talonfxs_neo2`, `talonfxs_neo550`, `talonfxs_vortex`, `talonfxs_pulsar`, `talonfxs_minion` |
| [SparkMAX](#sparkmax) | `sparkmax_neo`, `sparkmax_neo2`, `sparkmax_neo550`, `sparkmax_vortex`, `sparkmax_pulsar`, `sparkmax_minion` |
| [SparkFlex](#sparkflex) | `sparkflex_neo`, `sparkflex_neo2`, `sparkflex_neo550`, `sparkflex_vortex`, `sparkflex_pulsar`, `sparkflex_minion` |
| [Nova (ThriftyBot)](#thrifty-nova) | `nova_neo`, `nova_neo2`, `nova_neo550`, `nova_vortex`, `nova_pulsar`, `nova_minion` |

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is the full list the JSON schema accepts for feedforward/simulation purposes. It is **not** a
claim that every combination is physically wireable. Respect real hardware constraints: a TalonFX
is built into Kraken X44/X60 and Falcon 500 motors, and the other controllers only drive motors
their connectors and firmware support. Pick the row for your actual controller, and the `<motor>`
suffix that matches what's physically bolted to it.
{% endhint %}

Each controller family needs its vendor library installed in your robot project (Phoenix 6 for
`talonfx_*`/`talonfxs_*`, REVLib for `sparkmax_*`/`sparkflex_*`, ThriftyLib for `nova_*`). YAGSL
loads it by reflection only when your config uses that controller. See
[Vendordep Installation](../vendordep-installation.md).

Every controller takes a bus number in `canbus`. Only CTRE controllers (`talonfx_*`, `talonfxs_*`)
also take a name, for a CANivore. REV and Thrifty controllers reject anything other than `""` or a
bus number.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**CTRE default bus changed in 2027.** A TalonFX or TalonFXS with `"canbus": ""` is now on `can_s0`,
like every other vendor's devices. It used to end up on `can_s2`; if yours are wired to `can_s2`,
set `"canbus": "2"`.
{% endhint %}

## TalonFX (Kraken X60 / Kraken X44)

TalonFX is the controller for Kraken X44/X60 and (legacy) Falcon 500 motors. Commonly used as a
drive motor for its power and efficiency versus REV NEOs.

- [Kraken product page](https://wcproducts.com/products/kraken)
- Upgradeable/configurable via [Tuner X](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/latest/docs/tuner/index.html).
  Watch the LED status code when debugging. Settings changed in Tuner X are overwritten on startup
  by YAGSL.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If running Falcon 500 v2 (effectively discontinued), apply the
[Loctite fix](https://content.vexrobotics.com/vexpro/Falcon/217-6515-753-Falcon500-V2-Upgrade.pdf).
{% endhint %}

## TalonFXS

TalonFXS is CTRE's controller for third-party/non-Kraken brushless motors (NEO, NEO Vortex,
Minion, Pulsar) wired through CTRE's ecosystem, with the same Tuner X tooling and CAN/CANivore
support as TalonFX.

## SparkMAX

REV SparkMAX, brushless mode (NEO / NEO 550 / NEO Vortex / Minion / Pulsar via the appropriate
`<motor>` suffix).

- [Product page](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-2158/)
- Requires the [REV Hardware Client](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/gs/install)
  to test PID, run at a set percentage, and update firmware.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The SparkMAX must be disconnected from the CAN bus **on startup** to be recognized by the REV
Hardware Client.
{% endhint %}

To tune PID directly on the controller: open REV Hardware Client → select the SparkMAX → Telemetry
tab → set to position control while adjusting gains in the left pane.

**Checklist**

* [ ] Unique CAN ID.
* [ ] Latest firmware.
* [ ] Rotates CCW+ (invert programmatically if not).
* [ ] PID tuned for one drive motor and one angle motor before wiring the rest.

## SparkFlex

REV SparkFlex, brushless mode (same motor suffixes as SparkMAX, primarily used with NEO Vortex).

- [Product page](https://www.revrobotics.com/next-generation-spark-neo/)
- Same [REV Hardware Client](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client-2) workflow and
  startup-disconnect caveat as SparkMAX.

Both Spark controllers can read an absolute encoder plugged into their data port (the `_attached`
encoder types): see [Absolute Encoders](absolute-encoders.md#attached-encoders). `canbus` must be
`""` or a bus number; port names such as `"can_s1"` are no longer accepted.

## Thrifty Nova

ThriftyBot Nova, supported again in 2027 through YAMS's `NovaWrapper`. Requires the **ThriftyLib**
vendordep.

- `type` is `nova_<motor>`. YAGSL configures the Nova's own motor type from the suffix: `MINION`
  for `nova_minion`, `PULSAR` for `nova_pulsar`, and `NEO` for every other suffix.
- `canbus` must be `""` (for `can_s0`) or a bus number. Anything else is rejected with an error
  that lists the bus numbers.
- A Nova angle motor can read an absolute encoder plugged into its data port, including the Thrifty
  10 pin encoder (`thrifty_attached`). It does not support `analog5v_attached`. See
  [Absolute Encoders](absolute-encoders.md#attached-encoders).

**Checklist**

* [ ] Unique CAN ID.
* [ ] Latest firmware.
* [ ] Rotates CCW+ (invert programmatically if not).
* [ ] ThriftyLib vendordep installed.

### General motor tips (apply regardless of controller)

- Confirm CCW+ rotation on the bench before mounting. See [When to Invert](../../how-to/determine-inversion.md).
- Tune one drive motor and one angle motor fully before copying gains to the other three modules;
  see [Tune PIDF Gains](../../how-to/tune-pidf-gains.md).
- Current limits and gearing live in `physicalproperties.json` (or a per-module `gearing`
  override). See [physicalproperties.json Reference](../json-schema/physicalproperties-json.md).
