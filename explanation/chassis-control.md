# Chassis Control

Beyond individual module behavior, `SwerveDrive` and `SwerveDriveConfig` control a few chassis-wide concerns: how fast the robot is allowed to go, how commanded velocities get corrected for a subtle simulation-of-motion error, and how to make the robot maximally hard to push.

## Max Speed

YAMS stores a maximum module speed, plus an optional maximum chassis linear and angular speed, and uses them for `SwerveDriveKinematics.desaturateWheelVelocities`: scaling down all module speeds proportionally if any one module would need to exceed the physical maximum.

`SwerveParser` works out the maximum module speed for you from each drive motor's free speed, its gear ratio and the wheel diameter, and applies the slowest module's value with `SwerveDriveConfig.withMaximumModuleSpeed(...)`, so every module can reach what it is asked for. The same number gives the drive motors a default feedforward `kV` when `pidfproperties.json` leaves the drive `v` at `0`.

The maximum speed represents the physical maximum speed of the robot. It is not a "slow mode" throttle (use `SwerveInputStream.withScaleTranslation`/`withScaleRotation`, or scale your controller input directly, for that).

To also cap the chassis as a whole, set it once via `SwerveDriveConfig.withMaximumChassisSpeed(LinearVelocity, AngularVelocity)`:

```java
var cfg = new SwerveDriveConfig()
    .withMaximumChassisSpeed(MetersPerSecond.of(4.5), DegreesPerSecond.of(360));
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a setting on `SwerveDriveConfig`, not a JSON field. Set it in the code that builds your `SwerveDriveConfig` before passing it to `SwerveParser.createSwerveDrive(...)`.
{% endhint %}

## Chassis Speed Discretization

When you command a `ChassisVelocities` (WPILib 2027's name for `ChassisSpeeds`) with both translation and rotation, WPILib's `SwerveDriveKinematics` computes module states assuming that velocity is held constant for the whole next timestep. In reality your loop runs at a discrete rate (typically 20ms), and the true path curves slightly within that window. This shows up as unwanted skew/drift, especially at higher rotation rates.

`ChassisVelocities.discretize(dt)` corrects for this by working out what constant-velocity command over `dt` would actually produce the desired end pose. YAMS applies this automatically once a discretization time is set:

```java
var cfg = new SwerveDriveConfig()
    .withDiscretizationTime(Seconds.of(0.02))
    .withSimDiscretizationTime(Seconds.of(0.02)); // optionally different for simulation
```

You don't need to write this yourself when you use YAGSL: `SwerveParser.createSwerveDrive(...)` sets both the real and the simulation discretization time to 20 ms (matching the default robot loop period) on the `SwerveDriveConfig` you hand it, replacing any value you set beforehand. The builder calls above matter when you construct a `SwerveDriveConfig` without `SwerveParser`, where no discretization correction is applied unless you set a time.

## Lock Pose

Lock Pose is a special stance where all the wheels point inward into an X formation, making the robot extremely difficult to push. It's most useful for holding position during defense, or at the end of a match.

```java
drive.lockPose();
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Lock Pose should only be used when no other drive input is given, or you may get undefined/fighting behavior between the lock and your normal drive command.
{% endhint %}

A typical binding calls it repeatedly while a button is held:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Commands v2" %}
```java
driverXbox.x().whileTrue(Commands.run(drive::lockPose, driveSubsystem).withName("Lock Pose"));
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Commands v3" %}
```java
// In your swerve Mechanism:
public Command lockPose()
{
  return run(coroutine -> {
    while (true)
    {
      drive.lockPose();
      coroutine.yield();
    }
  }).named("Lock Pose");
}

// In your teleop opmode:
driverXbox.x().whileTrue(robot.swerve.lockPose());
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
