# How to use a custom gyro

{% hint style="info" %}
If your gyro is one of the [supported types](../reference/hardware/gyroscopes.md#supported-gyroscope-types)
(`pigeon2_can`, `canandgyro_can`, `navx3_can`, or the SystemCore's own IMU as `systemcore_internal`),
you don't need this page. Set `gyro.type` normally in `swervedrive.json`. The exception is the
NavX3: `navx3_can` does not work with YAGSL 2027 yet, because StudicaLib has no `2027_alpha7`
build, so use this page to supply it yourself once you have a way to read it.
{% endhint %}

Use a `custom` gyro when your heading source isn't one the parser builds for you: an IMU YAGSL has
no `type` string for, a heading fused from several sensors, or a gyro object you want to construct
and own yourself. Anything that can produce a WPILib `Rotation3d` works.

The examples below construct WPILib's `OnboardIMU` (the SystemCore's built-in IMU) by hand, because
every SystemCore has one. Swap in your own device; the wiring into YAGSL is identical.

## 1. Set `gyro.type` to `custom`

In `swervedrive.json`, set the gyro's `type` to `custom`. The `id`/`canbus` fields are unused for a
custom gyro (leave them at `0`/`""`), and `gyroAxis` and `gyroInvert` are **also ignored**, which is
the part that catches people out. The parser sees `custom` and skips gyro configuration entirely.

```json title="swervedrive.json"
{
  "gyro": { "type": "custom", "id": 0, "canbus": "" },
  "gyroAxis": "yaw",
  "gyroInvert": false,
  "modules": ["frontleft.json", "frontright.json", "backleft.json", "backright.json"]
}
```

## 2. Construct the gyro and supply it yourself

Because the parser never calls `SwerveDriveConfig.withGyro()` for a `custom` gyro, you call it
yourself on the `SwerveDriveConfig` you build **before** handing it to
`SwerveParser.createSwerveDrive(...)`. Modules, motor controllers and encoders are still built
normally from the rest of the JSON.

`withGyro` takes a `Supplier<Rotation3d>`: the gyro's full attitude (roll, pitch and yaw), not just
a heading angle. YAMS reads the heading out of it, and uses the roll and pitch for anti-tipping if
you enable it.

    drive = SwerveParser.createSwerveDrive(cfg);
  }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

If your device only reports a yaw angle, wrap it in a `Rotation3d` with zero roll and pitch:

```java
.withGyro(() -> new Rotation3d(0, 0, Math.toRadians(myGyro.getYawDegrees())))
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you forget to call `withGyro()` before `createSwerveDrive()`, YAMS has no attitude supplier to
read. Expect an `IllegalStateException` ("Gyro supplier is not set!") the first time the drive reads
its heading on a real robot, not a silent fallback.
{% endhint %}

## 3. Handle the heading axis and inversion yourself

Since `gyroAxis` and `gyroInvert` are ignored for a `custom` gyro, set their Java equivalents on
the same `SwerveDriveConfig`. Hand YAMS the gyro's attitude untouched and let it do both in one
place; don't negate or re-map angles inside your supplier as well, or they get applied twice.

```java
import yams.core.mechanisms.config.enums.GyroAxis;

.withGyro(gyro::getRotation3d)
.withGyroHeadingAxis(GyroAxis.YAW) // YAW is the default; ROLL or PITCH for a gyro mounted on its side
.withGyroInverted(true)            // only if the heading decreases when the robot turns counter-clockwise
```

| JSON field (ignored for `custom`) | Java equivalent                                    |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `gyroAxis`                        | `withGyroHeadingAxis(GyroAxis.YAW / PITCH / ROLL)` |
| `gyroInvert`                      | `withGyroInverted(boolean)`                        |

`withGyroHeadingAxis` says which axis of the gyro points up through the robot. YAMS rotates the
whole attitude into the robot's frame for that axis, then applies the inversion (and
`withGyroOffset(Angle)`, if you set one) to the resulting heading.

## 4. Verify it

Follow the normal [gyro CCW+ check](determine-inversion.md#2-confirm-the-gyro-reads-ccw).
`Mechanisms/swerve/gyro` in NetworkTables still populates and behaves exactly like a parser-built
gyro, since YAMS only ever sees a `Supplier<Rotation3d>` regardless of where it came from. If it
increases while the robot rotates counter-clockwise, you're done; if not, flip
`withGyroInverted(...)` from step 3 rather than `gyroInvert` in the JSON (which, again, is ignored).

In your own code, read the robot's attitude back with `drive.getGyroRotation3d()`, which has the
axis, inversion and offset applied. For just the heading, use
`drive.getGyroRotation3d().toRotation2d()`. (`SwerveDrive.getGyroAngle()` no longer exists.)

{% hint style="info" %}
In simulation YAMS reports its simulated heading from `getGyroRotation3d()` and never calls your
supplier, so a custom gyro needs no simulation support of its own.
{% endhint %}

## Optional: angular velocity for skew correction

Gyro-based angular-velocity skew correction (see
[Swerve Drive Drift](../reference/swerve-drift-causes.md)) is off until you set a scale factor. The
parser never sets one for any gyro, custom or not:

```java
import static org.wpilib.units.Units.RadiansPerSecond;

.withGyroAngularVelocityScaleFactor(1.0)
.withGyroVelocity(() -> RadiansPerSecond.of(gyro.getGyroRateZ()))
```

`withGyroVelocity` is optional. Without it YAMS differentiates the heading from `withGyro` instead
(and raises a low-priority alert saying so), which is fine for most robots; supply the gyro's own
yaw rate when it has a cleaner one.

{% hint style="warning" %}
`withGyroInverted` and `withGyroHeadingAxis` apply to the attitude only, not to the supplier you
pass to `withGyroVelocity`. The rate must already be counter-clockwise positive about the robot's
vertical axis: if you needed `withGyroInverted(true)`, negate the rate, and if you changed the
heading axis, read the rate from that same axis, or the skew correction will fight the heading
it's supposed to be correcting.
