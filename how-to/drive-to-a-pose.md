# How to drive to a pose

`SwerveDrive.driveToPose(Pose2d)` drives straight to a field-relative pose using two PID
controllers on `SwerveDriveConfig`. No path planning is involved, just "go here." It's a good fit
for short, single-target moves: aligning to a scoring location, a loading station, or a fixed
AprilTag-relative setpoint. For multi-point autonomous routines with obstacle-aware paths, see
[How to set up PathPlanner](setup-pathplanner.md) instead (Commands v2 only; on Commands v3
`driveToPose` is what you have).

{% hint style="warning" %}
`driveToPose` is **not compatible with AdvantageKit** replay (per its javadoc), because it reads
gyro/pose state live inside the command rather than through a logged input.
{% endhint %}

## 1. Give the drive translation and rotation controllers

`SwerveParser` doesn't set these for you. There's no JSON field for them, since they're a
robot-code concern, not a per-robot hardware description. Set them on the `SwerveDriveConfig`
before calling `createSwerveDrive(...)`:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Commands v2" %}
```java title="SwerveDriveSubsystem.java"
import org.wpilib.math.controller.PIDController;
import swervelib.commands2.SwerveParser;
import yams.commands2.config.SwerveDriveConfig;
import yams.core.telemetry.SwerveDriveTelemetryConfig;
import yams.core.telemetry.enums.TelemetryVerbosity;

var cfg = new SwerveDriveConfig()
    .withStartingPose(new Pose2d(3, 3, Rotation2d.ZERO))
    .withSubsystem(this)
    .withTranslationController(new PIDController(4, 0, 0)) // input: meters of position error
    .withRotationController(new PIDController(3, 0, 0))    // input: radians of heading error
    .withTelemetry("swerve", new SwerveDriveTelemetryConfig(TelemetryVerbosity.HIGH));

SwerveParser.parse(new File(Filesystem.getDeployDirectory(), "swerve/base"));
drive = SwerveParser.createSwerveDrive(cfg);
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Commands v3" %}
```java title="SwerveDriveMechanism.java"
import org.wpilib.math.controller.PIDController;
import swervelib.commands3.SwerveParser;
import yams.commands3.config.SwerveDriveConfig;
import yams.core.telemetry.SwerveDriveTelemetryConfig;
import yams.core.telemetry.enums.TelemetryVerbosity;

var cfg = new SwerveDriveConfig()
    .withStartingPose(new Pose2d(3, 3, Rotation2d.ZERO))
    .withMechanism(this)
    .withTranslationController(new PIDController(4, 0, 0)) // input: meters of position error
    .withRotationController(new PIDController(3, 0, 0))    // input: radians of heading error
    .withTelemetry("swerve", new SwerveDriveTelemetryConfig(TelemetryVerbosity.HIGH));

SwerveParser.parse(new File(Filesystem.getDeployDirectory(), "swerve/base"));
drive = SwerveParser.createSwerveDrive(cfg);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The gains above are the YAGSL examples' placeholders, not values tuned for your robot. The
translation controller's output is a speed toward the target in meters per second; the rotation
controller's is radians per second. To use different gains in simulation, add
`withSimTranslationController(...)`/`withSimRotationController(...)`.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If a `driveToPose` command runs without both controllers set, YAMS throws a
`SwerveDriveConfigurationException` rather than silently picking a default, since an untuned
default would just as likely fight the robot as help it.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
YAMS stops any module asked for less than 0.1 m/s (its default module velocity deadband), so a
rotation gain that's too low leaves the robot a few degrees short of the heading you asked for and
unable to close the rest. At `kP = 3` that dead zone is under 4.5 degrees.
{% endhint %}

The rotation controller is the same one `SwerveInputStream`'s heading control uses (see
[Heading Correction](../explanation/module-behaviors.md#heading-correction-heading-snap-control)).
If you've already tuned heading control, you have a reasonable starting point for `driveToPose`
too. Both controllers can be tuned live from a dashboard, see
[live tuning](tune-pidf-gains.md#live-tuning).

## 2. Wrap it in a command that knows when to stop

`driveToPose(Pose2d)` never finishes on its own. It keeps correcting toward the target pose until
something cancels it, the same way your teleop default command never finishes.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/yagsl-drive-to-pose.gif" alt="An animation of a robot driving across the field to a target pose while turning to face it. The distance from the pose, from getDistanceFromPose, and the angle difference, from getAngleDifferenceFromPose, count down. When the distance is under 2 inches and the angle under 5 degrees, the until condition becomes true and the command ends."><figcaption><p>The command ends once the robot is within both tolerances.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Commands v2" %}
Race it against a tolerance check (or a timeout) so it actually ends:

```java title="SwerveDriveSubsystem.java"
import static org.wpilib.units.Units.Degrees;
import static org.wpilib.units.Units.Inches;

public Command driveToPose(Pose2d pose) {
  return drive.driveToPose(pose)
      .until(() -> drive.getDistanceFromPose(pose).in(Inches) < 2
                && Math.abs(drive.getAngleDifferenceFromPose(pose).in(Degrees)) < 5);
}
```

`SwerveDrive.getDistanceFromPose(Pose2d)` and `getAngleDifferenceFromPose(Pose2d)` give you the
current translation/rotation error against any pose, so the tolerance check above works for any
target, not just the one you started the command with.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Commands v3" %}
The Commands v3 `SwerveDrive` has a second overload that ends by itself once the robot is within
tolerance, and stops the drive when it ends or is canceled:

```java title="SwerveDriveMechanism.java"
import static org.wpilib.units.Units.Degrees;
import static org.wpilib.units.Units.Inches;

public Command driveToPose(Pose2d pose) {
  return drive.driveToPose(pose, Inches.of(2), Degrees.of(5));
}
```

To chain several poses, await each one inside a coroutine, the way the Commands v3 example's
`driveRelativeWaypoints` does:

```java
public Command driveSquare(List<Pose2d> poses) {
  return run(coroutine -> {
    for (Pose2d pose : poses) {
      coroutine.await(driveToPose(pose));
    }
  }).named("Drive Square");
}
```

`drive.isNear(pose, translationTolerance, rotationTolerance)` is the same check the overload
uses, if you want it in your own loop.

{% hint style="info" %}
The tolerance overload ends as soon as the robot is inside the tolerance, even if it's still
moving. To settle on a final pose, finish with the plain `drive.driveToPose(pose)`, which holds
the pose until it is canceled.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

If you'd rather hold at the pose indefinitely (for example while a button is held), skip the
tolerance and let whatever takes over next interrupt it. That's exactly what a bare
`drive.driveToPose(pose)` does.

## 3. Bind it

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Commands v2" %}
```java title="RobotContainer.java"
driverXbox.y().whileTrue(swerve.driveToPose(new Pose2d(3, 3, Rotation2d.fromDegrees(180))));
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Commands v3" %}
```java
driverXbox.y().whileTrue(robot.swerve.driveToPose(new Pose2d(3, 3, Rotation2d.fromDegrees(180))));
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Pass a fixed pose for a known field feature, or a pose computed on the fly (from vision, or the
nearest of a set of candidate poses). `driveToPose` doesn't care where the `Pose2d` came from.

{% hint style="info" %}
The pose is field-relative with the blue-alliance wall as the origin, `0°` facing the red alliance
wall, the same convention `SwerveDrive.getPose()`/odometry already use. If you're computing poses
per-alliance, flip them yourself for the red alliance; `driveToPose` does not.
{% endhint %}
